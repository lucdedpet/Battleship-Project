Decisions
=========
 * Each member should write unit tests for 2 work items that they have completed during the past 2 Sprints
  
 * Members should self assign themselves to these tasks and add them to Trello, in the Unit Testing Backlog list

 * Unit tests should be written using the NUnit test fixture

Actions
=======
 Everyone: Pick 2 work items as outlined above and add the cards to Trello along with actually creating the unit tests
