Decisions
=========
Game crashing bugs and features will be postponed until all visual bugs have been fixed

Group members should assign themselves to a card after the Wednesday lab, even if they do not start 
working on it immediately. This is in order to keep track of workloads.

Actions
=======
Sam: Fixing shots counter bug and high score name entry bug.

Lucien: Fixing ship placement bugs 2.1 and 2.2

James: Fixing ship placement bug 3.1
