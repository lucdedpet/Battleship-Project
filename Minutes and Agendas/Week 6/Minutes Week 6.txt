Decisions
=========
* Trello task assignment: Since the errors coincide with each other it would be simpler
  to have members assign themselves to cards instead of individual lists

* New main branch from which everyone will work off of, is 'cs-convert'

Actions
=======
* Everyone: Assign themselves to an error and work on it, show workings on github

* James: Update error list, because errors have changed since fixing them

* Adeel: Add detailed descriptions to project's functions, classes and variables

* Everyone: Once all errors have been fixed, merge into 'cs-convert' and start documenting individual methods
  (If using Xamarin, commenting can be done by adding a '///' above the method, which creates an XML style 
  of commenting which you can then edit)
