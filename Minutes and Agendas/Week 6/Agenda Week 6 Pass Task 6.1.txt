General Items
=============

* The Trello board needs to be updated ready for the planned Sprint process. In particular columns 
  for project backlog and sprint backlog will be needed.

* Create and link the team slack so that we can be notified and have a nice record of the Trello updates.

* The project backlog of tasks needs to be created. Use the existing bugs and features we have documented,
  and convert to the required format. Need a meeting after this meeting to get that done and into Trello (today).

* Project backlog tasks need to be prioritised and their time estimated using 1,2,4,8 hour categories. (Today)

* The new Sprint backlog needs to be pre-selected ready for discussion and approval with the project owner. (Today)

* Once Sprint has started, hold a daily scrum meeting. (Start next week?)
