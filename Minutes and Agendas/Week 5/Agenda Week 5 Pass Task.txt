Information Updates/Reminders
=============================
* Last week was about analysing the legacy code.

* This week is about converting and documenting the code

* Next week we will use a sprint process over two weeks to fix
  bugs and extend the project. (No bug fixing or extensions yet!)

* Everyone should be able to use the team git repo, github wiki’s
  and Trello. Ask for help (tutor or team) if that’s a problem.

* Everyone should have used toggl.com to track their time last week.
  Also track time on tasks this week with Toggl.

* Tutor must be added to github, trello and toggl.

* The Programming Help Desk ATC620 is *still* available to help us
  with programming for this unit.

Decisions Needed
================
* What tool(s) will be used to do the conversion, based on the report?

* What coding standard will be used for C#, based on the report?

General Items
=============
* Add tutor account to team tools (github, wiki, toggle)

* Code needs to be converted, and the converted code committed to
  the repository. (Note – repository must start with VB code.)

* Converted code will need the appropriate SwinGame files to build
  and run the C# code.

* Missing code documentation (identified by report) needs to be
  fixed in the converted code. Can be shared by several people

* Converted and running code functionality needs to be checked to
  make sure it is the same as before (Validation). Suggest a
  checklist (list of functions?) to document the before and after
  result.

* There may be missing features, bugs or extension ideas that have
  not been identified and documented. This will be needed for the
  up-coming two-week sprint, so we should continue to look for these
  and note what they are.
